## _How can we create a culture of humane technology inside of our workplaces and broader industry?_

_"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better."_
— Maya Angelou

**So how do you change paradigms?**
Donella Meadows provides an answer in Places to Intervene in a System:

"Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science, has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell:

1. You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm.

2. You keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance, from the new paradigm.

3. You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power.

You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded."

- Donella Meadows

Humane technologists build on a long history of people pushing back against extractive technologies, from those who resisted colonization to those who fought the centralization and commercialization of the internet. We live in a time when the harms of extractive technology are showing up in headlines, in our families, and in the families of our elected leaders. Faith in the old paradigm is at an all time low, while the desire to find viable alternatives has never been higher.

Changes like this can feel daunting, but two ways of thinking can be particularly supportive: the spirit of service and openness to learning. Both are powerful because they reduce the resistance that often comes from our ego. When we serve, we remember the massive gaps in privilege around us and we can connect with our sincere desire to help. And when we’re interested in learning, our sense of self automatically becomes less rigid, because learning requires change and acknowledgement that we don’t have all the answers.

Giant redwoods germinate best after a fire. They spread seeds around the forest floor, often in the shade of trees that grow faster but are less resilient, and when a fire comes through their cones open and take root.
