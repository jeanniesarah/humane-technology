### **Module 3 | Minimizing Harmful Consequences**

We‚Äôll explore new paradigms for economic and value systems that allow companies to address and reduce externalities.

_What economic forces affect products, and how can product teams help address and reduce harmful externalities?_

TLDR: systemic fragility will persist as long as it is culturally and legally justifiable.

#### Introduction

A humane technologist is in a continual process of identifying and accounting for the externalities (unaccounted side effects) of their products.

Mindsets and paradigms give rise to complex systems like our economic system. Donella Meadows described these paradigms as:

> the shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions‚Äîunstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows them. They are society's deepest set of beliefs about how the world works.

A few of the paradigms that drive most Western societies might include:

- Growth is good
- One can "own" land
- People are perfectly "rational" economic actors
- Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purposes

  Beyond being ‚Äúmere ideas,‚Äù these cultural assumptions are eventually codified into institutional policy and law, becoming some of the most fundamental forces directing human behavior, including technology design. Over time, this has led to a seemingly ubiquitous social structure designed to achieve exponential growth of economic productivity.
  **Our institutional policies are built with the assumption that money is a good proxy for human values.**

#### Economic Systems

(-) **Extraction**: To produce value in a market, resources must be captured, removed from their existing context, and commodified for sale. Extraction occurs when a company removes resources from an environment more quickly than they can be replenished.
(+) **Stewardship**: To create long-term value, extraction must be balanced with stewardship. If extraction is about creating value through capture and removal, stewardship is about creating value by helping value thrive in place. Leaving a tree in place or leaving someone‚Äôs attention uncaptured can in the long run create more value (including but not limited to more capturable value), than extracting value as quickly as possible.

**Efficiency and Scale**
**When companies** _**extract value at scale**_ **more efficiently, they also** _**destroy value at scale**_ **more efficiently.**

**By destroying value‚Äîoften in ways that are hard to perceive‚Äîefficiency and scale also lead to** _**fragility**_**.** Systems that have been subject to large-scale extraction are susceptible to sudden unexpected collapse, whether they are ecosystems or democratic societies.

**As technology helps companies become more efficient and more profitable, those companies over-extract resources from systems we depend on. When those resources are depleted, our physiological, social, and ecological systems fail.**

**Competiton**
Unchecked competition can lead to the creation of **multi-polar traps**, situations in which everyone engages in harmful behavior not because they want to, but because competitive dynamics demand that they do so.
Often the best way to escape a multi-polar trap is to band together and change the rules. Competition must be balanced with **collaboration** and **regulation**, especially in places where extraction at scale creates widespread risks. Just as businesses need markets to compete in, they need movements to collaborate in, especially when those businesses are values-driven. Cooperatives like [Zebras Unite](https://zebrasunite.coop/) are a good entry point for exploring the benefits of this sort of collaboration.

**Humane technologists understand how to find a balance: how to embrace efficiency and growth in places where powerful forms of value can be created, and to embrace stewardship and collaboration when powerful forms of value are at risk of being destroyed.**

#### Externalities in Technology

Recall the quote from renowned sociobiologist Dr. E. O. Wilson:

> The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology. And it is terrifically dangerous, and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.

Our increasingly god-like technology is now overwhelming fundamental human limits. So when an economy driven by competition and extraction is accelerated by exponentially-advancing technology‚Äïwith our own minds as the resource being extracted from‚Äïcivilization as we know it is at stake.

##### üõ† Externality Rubric

Access an externality as a team using this rubric with questions and examples:

- **Scale of the externality.** How widespread will it be? - _Over 50% of the world‚Äôs population has recently come online or will likely come online in the next two decades. They would be disadvantaged by this algorithm._
- **Stakes of the impact.** For example, is the impact irreversible? - _This externality creates online discussion dominated by a small number of wealthier individuals. This contributes to inequality and can cause real-world harm if some of those individuals engage in heavily amplified hate speech or disinformation._
- **Vulnerability of the group or system impacted.** How exposed is it? - _Societies moving online are going through a critical transition point where amplified inequality can have long-term consequences._
- **Long-term costs.** If this externality is left unaddressed, who will bear the cost and how costly will it be? - _The people who had the early advantage end up with growing, outsized control over online discourse, and use their power to maintain it._
- **Paths to reduction.** How might less of this externality be created? - _Expand the range of voices elevated by recommendation systems, even if this reduces engagement._

#### How Can We Mitigate Externalities?

Historically, companies built on extractive paradigms create enough widespread harm that they eventually face pressure from the public, shareholders, and regulators. Forced to invest resources commensurate to the harms they‚Äôve created, their overly-extractive business models become unsustainable.

Technology‚Äîespecially social media‚Äîis seeing this same reckoning today as users, governments, and technologists alike come to understand what‚Äôs at stake, and the urgent need for change.

Good regulation shifts the terrain of the competitive landscape by aligning financial incentives with the well-being of individuals, society, and the natural world.

#### Regenerative Systems

**Whereas extractive systems exhaust resources by removing them faster than they replenish, regenerative systems protect and enrich what they depend on. Extractive systems are parasitic, while regenerative systems are symbiotic.**

Consider a few examples:

- A regenerative economy would protect the natural energy systems that power it.
- In a regenerative system, social media would protect opportunities for offline connection.
- A company born from a culture of open ideas and debate would safeguard democratic ideals that gave rise to that culture.
- A creator who builds on a rich cultural lineage would be grounded in and support the community of that lineage.

#### THE PATH TO REGENERATIVE SYSTEMS

Viewed through the lens of a purely capitalist economic system, regenerative systems often seem impossible. Extractive behavior is more competitive, which means that well-meaning attempts at regenerative behavior are doomed to fail.

But what if we view market competition as one element within a larger system? In Donut Economics, Kate Raworth argues that our economic systems must be productive enough to meet human needs and contained enough to avoid exceeding ecological limits. Economies outside the ‚Äúdonut‚Äù are headed toward inevitable collapse.

**Instead of doing** _**more**_**, the sustainable, regenerative answer is often to do** _**less**_. Rather than creating a technological solution to address an externality, we can work to reduce the externality itself:

- Regenerative healthy lifestyles are more robust than investing in new drugs.
- Implementing energy efficiency programs so that we use _less energy_ is very often cheaper and more environmentally friendly than generating _more energy_ from renewable sources.
- An app that uses a subscription model doesn‚Äôt need to create engagement maximizing algorithms that create addiction. The app simply needs to provide a high-quality service that makes the subscription worth the cost to the user, which could include very light or minimal screen time.

Addressing harmful externalities by doing less of the activities that generate them gives humans and our ecosystem a chance to get healthy again.

## Key Takeaways

- Harmful externalities aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù to products or captured in company earnings‚Äîtheir costs show up elsewhere, often in the lives of poorer people and future generations.
- Humane technologists engage in a continual process of identifying and accounting for the externalities of their products.

- As technology helps companies become more competitive, more efficient and more profitable, those companies over-extract resources from systems we depend on, causing those systems to fail.
- Once we‚Äôre operating at an unsustainably extractive scale, attempts to address the problems created by technology with more technology are likely to lead to a larger set of problems. Instead, the sustainable, regenerative answer is often to reduce harmful externalities directly.
- Whereas extractive systems exhaust resources by removing them faster than they replenish, regenerative systems protect and enrich what they depend on. Extractive systems are parasitic, while regenerative systems are symbiotic.
- Good regulation aligns financial incentives with the well-being of individuals, society, and the natural world.
- Match each of your KPIs with an anti-KPI ‚Äúmeasure of failure.‚Äù
- Listen to the people who are potentially most negatively impacted by your product.
- Engage with existing scholarship, activism, and lived experience around externalities
- A more considerate, intelligent, long-term viable design process _is possible_. It starts with understanding externalities and factoring them as design constraints.

When we examine negative externalities, we might realize that an idea we‚Äôve been excited about no longer feels wise. This can feel sad or disempowering. So what do you do?

**As humane technologists, we must stay in touch with a spirit of service, asking what the world truly needs from us, rather than which of our ideas the world has adopted.**
