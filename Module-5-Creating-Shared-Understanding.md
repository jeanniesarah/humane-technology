### **Module 5 | Creating Shared Understanding**

We’ll look at how technology can engender trust, good will, and understanding, while weaving a stronger social fabric.

_How can technology engender the trust and understanding we need to solve complex problems together?_

## Key Takeaways

- Shared understanding is critical for navigating complex challenges like climate change, social inequity, or conflicts.

- To fix symptoms in a lasting way, we must understand the decade-long shaping process that has gradually warped our perceptions of each other.
- Today’s dominant social media platforms produce a number of distortions related to: engaging content, influencer training, extreme emotion, microtargeting, othering, disloyalty, information flooding, and weakening journalism.

- There are three parts to creating a healthier information ecosystem: fixing the causes, fixing the crises, and fixing the conditioning of our minds and habits.

- Fix the causes:

  - Introduce viral friction.
  - Push for amplification that creates more “small-peak” winners instead of a small number of giant peaks.
  - Alter algorithms to decrease perception gaps
  - Ask how digital spaces can draw inspiration from the design of physical spaces.
  - Guide people to build empathy by sharing their backgrounds and conditions with each other.
  - Learn from open digital democracies that are leading the way.
  - Provide avenues for de-escalation.

- Address the crises:
  - Plan for rapid response.
  - Watch for crises among non-users.
  - Maintain cross-product collaboration.
  - Proactively counter conspiracy theories.
- Heal the conditioning of our minds and habits:
  - Rehumanize, then depolarize.
  - Educate the public.
  - Encourage small, facilitated conversations
  - Help people find commonalities.
  - Illustrate distortions.
