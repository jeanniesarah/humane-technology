### **Module 1 | Setting the Stage** (completed)

We open with an overview of the complex environment technology is developed in, including social, psychological, and economic structures and paradigms.

_What challenges define this moment in history and how can the technology we build help to address them?_

##### [Challenges to Making Sense of the 21st Century](https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/)

There is a **hyperobject** that can be labeled as “postmodern psychological warfare,” which is widespread, and works against public sensemaking. The “hyper-battlefield” is in your pocket, if not already in the palm of your hand. Note that this means there is a hyperobject (the hyper-battlefield) within the hyperobject (your smart phone) that you are using to gain visibility to hyperobjects in the world (such as pandemics and climate change). The Internet presented to you on your phone is not a neutral tool to aid you in your individual sensemaking. Neither is social media a neutral tool to aid everyone in open public sensemaking. Websites such as Facebook and YouTube are optimized to keep our attention, not to help us learn. They curate a seemingly infinite amount of content using real-time, individualized data tracking and analytics to accomplish their goal of capturing our attention. The platforms are agents rather than neutral curators, with goals that involve our attention which are different than the goals we have for our own attention. We may take to the Internet to learn something, but most of the sites you visit are not designed to help us learn; they are designed to keep us “engaged,” which means returning to the site again and again and staying on site for longer and longer. Engagement is not the same as learning, and in many cases it is antithetical. Engagement is only one of the epistemically problematic design goals to which you are subject on a regular basis when using digital technologies.

##### [Practicing Epistemic Humility: Towards a New Ethos of Learning](https://consilienceproject.org/challenges-to-making-sense-of-the-21st-century/)

The future of democracies, as open societies, requires a fundamental upgrade in our educational and informational infrastructures. The dawn of our understanding of hyperobjects, in the context of a risk society, mediated through weaponized digital media, has created a perfect storm that is enveloping us. Hubristic denial has been one reaction, nihilistic opportunism another.

We propose _humility_ as the best response. This should lead to ongoing mutual learning. By humility we imply curiosity, commitment, and a motivation to pursue further learning, rather than deference or subservience, as religious connotations of such a virtue can imply. We believe that this kind of humility provides the core of a new ethos of learning that is and ought to be emerging.

##### Navigating Complicated vs Complex Systems

A complicated system has a lot of moving parts, but you can hypothetically know everything about it. You can gain expertise in the system by learning rules, applying decision procedures, and designing algorithms.

Complicated systems are highly predictable. They do not adapt and change of their own accord, which often makes them brittle. Some examples of complicated systems include:

- a car engine
- an intricate Swiss watch
- a computer

A complex system, on the other hand, is constantly evolving. Any interaction or change in the system has cascading effects that multiply possible outcomes and make many forms of prediction impossible. Because they are constantly adapting in unexpected ways, these systems can also be highly resilient. Think of:

- ecosystems like rainforests and oceans
- psychological development and learning
- human-computer interaction

If you have a problem with a complicated system, you can observe it, analyze its full state of behaviors, and respond accordingly. You can do this because you know in advance there is a well-defined answer. There are clear pathways to a solution if you understand the system’s governing rules well enough.

Complex systems require a different approach. You can’t know all of the system’s variables and dynamics, or even what success looks like. _Sensemaking theorist Dave Snowden says that complex systems require one to “probe, sense, and respond” rather than to “sense, analyze, and respond,” which is the method we apply to complicated systems._

To navigate complex systems, we must “put out probes” or “perform experiments” within the system based on the best hypotheses available at the time, noticing how it changes, and then adapting. Moreover, adaptation isn’t simply becoming more efficient at “solving the problem.” It is also changing your understanding of what the problem is.

Donella Meadows, one of the most influential systems thinkers of the 20th century, defines the cultural paradigm as “The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions… which constitute that society’s... deepest set of beliefs about how the world works.”

PLACES TO INTERVENE IN A SYSTEM (in increasing order of effectiveness)

12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).
13. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
14. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
15. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
16. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
17. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
18. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
19. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
20. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
21. The goals of the system.
22. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
23. The power to transcend paradigms.

##### Donella Meadows' [Dancing with Systems](https://donellameadows.org/archives/dancing-with-systems/)

The Dance

1. Get the beat.
2. Listen to the wisdom of the system.
3. Expose your mental models to the open air.
4. Stay humble. Stay a learner.
5. Honor and protect information.
6. Locate responsibility in the system.
7. Make feedback policies for feedback systems.
8. Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable.
9. Go for the good of the whole.
10. Expand time horizons.
11. Expand thought horizons.
12. Expand the boundary of caring.
13. Celebrate complexity.
14. Hold fast to the goal of goodness.

##### The Leverage Points Framework

The Leverage Points Framework shows that change happens at multiple levels with different degrees of impact. Here are working definitions and examples for each lever:

**Design Changes**: These are adjustments that technology companies themselves make in the visual design and user experience of their platforms. For example, platforms can choose to prompt users via a notification to read an article before sharing it. Or, as #OneClickSafer proposes, the Share button’s use can be restricted. While design changes can have material impact, they don't address root cause issues stemming from the levels further along the lever.

**Internal Governance**: These changes are implemented by decision-makers within platforms to shift how internal systems and structures operate. Examples include creating an Oversight Board to supervise the safety of design features (not simply adjudicating whether a piece of content is bad or good) or changing employee bonuses to reward actions that increase people's safety and well-being instead of increasing user engagement.

**External Regulation**: This occurs when outside forces, such as legislators or regulators, pass laws that set requirements related to safety, transparency, interoperability with competing platforms, or create liabilities for unsafe business practices or harms. While these changes take longer to enact, they are more enduring and tend to be higher impact. Recent examples include the GDPR, COPPA, and the proposed KIDS Act.

**Business Model**: These changes shift the fundamental operations and profit structures of a firm, for example, moving to a subscription model with a sliding scale to ensure broad access. New, more humane business models can justify regulation against extractive business models and redirect flows of capital from investors.

**Economic Goal**: Redefining economic success can radically alter how systems behave. This happens when economic systems reward new, more humane ways of creating value, or penalize harms that were previously ignored. For example, in order to address climate change, our global economic system must adapt to see carbon emission as costly and carbon sequestration as valuable. Certain activities, like extracting human attention, must become less profitable while new ways of creating value, like building trust, are incentivized.

**Operating Paradigm**: Paradigm changes are the highest leverage point and generally the most difficult to shift. They occur when there is widespread change in core beliefs, values, behaviors, and operating norms. Examples include:

A mass shift in consumer sentiment, as with Big Tobacco and cigarettes, which went from being seen as "cool" to lethal and foolish. A similar shift could happen where the public sees "viral engagement" social media as harmful to society.

As a society, changing the North Star of what we’re seeking. This could be done by asking ourselves, is our ultimate goal to have “30% less toxic social media” than we do now? Or is it to build humane technology that enables thriving in the 21st century?

A change in the cultural beliefs of technologists, seeing old, extractive behaviors clearly and operating from more humane principles.

##### We need humane technology that:

- Enhances our potential for focus, shared understanding, and deep collaboration.
- Strengthens our capacity to tackle our biggest global challenges.
- Protects our common good and our own well-being so we can be of service to each other.
- Allows digital democratic societies to compete on the global stage with digital authoritarian societies.
