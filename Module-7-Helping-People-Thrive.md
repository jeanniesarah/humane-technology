### **Module 7 | Helping People Thrive**

We’ll complete our journey through humane technology with a thoughtful and practical look at how we can help ourselves and those around us be our best.

_How can products help people act in alignment with their deeper intentions, rather than optimizing for engagement?_

#### Introduction

_"The question is not how to survive, but how to thrive with passion, compassion, humor and style."_
— Maya Angelou

**What is the end to which all other activities are but means?**
Our activities and efforts, our work and our hobbies, our love and our service—all of these efforts support thriving. Our own thriving, and, crucially, that of others.

We care about shared reality, about unintended consequences, about equity and justice and minimizing harms precisely because they contribute to thriving.

We fight against the commodification of our attention, compulsivity, and the micro-realities slicing our social fabric because they compromise thriving.

The word “thriving” may or may not capture all this for you, but in the context of this module, “thriving” refers to that which makes life worth living.

Thriving is deeply interwoven with happiness, ethics, and values. These affect both individuals and communities of every size. While “happiness” and “thriving” are sometimes used interchangeably, **we use "thriving" as a full-spectrum happiness: wellbeing infused with meaning, self-discovery, growth, and care for the rest of life.** Unlike forms of happiness that are dependent on the circumstances of our lives being arranged to our specifications, thriving is less fragile and vulnerable to the ups and downs of life.

**What are your gifts to offer?**

The question of thriving should always be close at hand. This course exists to contribute to the thriving of individuals and communities. And you’re here because you care about that, too.

In this module, we:

- Explore the concept of thriving, and how it can inform our approach to building humane technology.

​- Examine technology’s illusions that masquerade as thriving but actually compromise wellbeing.

​- Look at specific ways that technology can support thriving.

#### Questions to Ask

Consider these questions as you’re designing technology:

1. How can you design defaults and incentives that encourage people to act in alignment with their values?

​2. How might you deliver the same value to people’s lives while using less of their time and attention?

​3. Once you have created a valuable experience for a user, how might you help them refocus their attention on what matters most to them?

​4. How might the products you build show respect for focus by minimizing distractions and interruptions?

#### Key Takeaways

- We can consider thriving to be a special kind of happiness: wellbeing infused with meaning, self-discovery, and care for the rest of life.

- The question of thriving should always be a north star.

- What erodes autonomy, competence, or relatedness erodes thriving.

- We can thrive by cultivating a balanced, patient relationship with the current moment, rather than by striving to add pleasure or remove pain from it.

​- Don’t water seeds of compulsivity with the empty promise of a new experience that finally fulfills you.

​- Relentlessly hijacking attention is a direct assault on our autonomy—and our thriving.

​- Don’t be tricked by the illusions of thriving: (1) manufactured desire, (2) unchecked growth, (3) gratifying destructive emotions, (4) distracted downtime

​- Humane technologists must not only help individuals thrive, but also support that thriving by creating conditions for a more equitable and engaged social fabric, including journalism, elections, education and civic infrastructure.

- People systemically overlook the value of simplification as opposed to addition when improving objects, ideas, or situations.
