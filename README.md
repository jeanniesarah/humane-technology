### Foundations of Humane Technology Program

The Fundamentals of Humane Technology program explores the personal, societal, and practical challenges of being a humane technologist.

From extreme weather to growing inequity, humanity is facing catastrophic and even existential risks. We can choose whether the technology we build will accelerate these challenges or help build the capacity to meet them.

[_Foundations of Humane Technology_](https://go.participate.com/humanetechnology) will **prepare product teams** to create technology that treats attention and intention as sacred, protects well-being, minimizes unforeseen consequences, and ultimately **builds our collective capacity** to address the most urgent challenges facing humanity.
